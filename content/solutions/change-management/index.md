### Welcome
As I write, I am watching my husband narrate a story to my boys about what they are going to eat for lunch. I have two little boys - One of them welcomes new food all the time while the other one does not eat even if there is a slight change in texture. My husband prepares them well ahead on what to expect so that the plates are finished.

It stuck me how we handle change at work. At home, It is two small boys having similar upbringing and little gap in age showing different types of resistance to change. At work, We have people from diverse backgrounds - culture, education and experience. Imagine the resistance people can bring in when change is introduced. 

### Resistance

It is important to understand the difference between Obstacle and Resistance. Obstacle can be ineffective change management in company, lack of planning or support. Resistance is action or behavior by people to challenge the threat. I question people who say resistance is bad. To me, being passive is bad. Resistance does not mean people are not ready to change. They express openly by resisting. They want to know more. You need to win them over. Resistance shapes the change - strategy, the approach and make the vision clear. It is a more of a boon than ban to a change leader.

There are number of studies establishing relationship between people's resistance to change and their personality. In this article about [Dispositional resistance](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0021886317741867), The author goes through the four dimensions of people behavior - Routine, emotional reactions, short-term focus and cognitive rigidity that can constitute to resistance to change. Also, Organization culture and leaders influence how people in the organization respond to change. 



### Change Agent

As a leader,
- Can you challenge the status-quo and create disruption?
- Do you have to ability to anticipate, facilitate and take the change forward?
- Do you have a compelling story to emotionally appeal to people so they sell what you are selling?
- Can you remove the obstacles and convert resistance to support?
- Can you take diversions gracefully?
- Can you identify your change catalyst and empower them to sustain the forward momentum?
- Do you have systemic way to monitor, control, measure the success and recognize people?

If your answer is yes, You are on the right path. 

There are quite a few change models leaders can follow. I personally, have found Lewin's change model being very simple and useful in managing change at my level. 
Finally, I leave with the thought of Albert Einstein.
- “The measure of intelligence is the ability to change”
